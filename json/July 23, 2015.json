of hearing me talk about VR. Every time I talked about it, she was like &amp;quot;Shut up it&amp;#39;s not that cool,&amp;quot; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT! Now she understands!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, I want to explain why the HTC guys are my best friends now. If you just want to read about the demo I&amp;#39;ll put a &amp;quot;**&amp;quot; where that starts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This past Friday we were trying to figure out something to do for a date. All the movies at the Cinemax suck right now... &amp;#39;Hey, that HTC Vive Tour is in Louisville this weekend. Let&amp;#39;s just skip the movie and go tomorrow!&amp;#39; It was a 6-hour drive and she wasn&amp;#39;t excited about it. It took some convincing, but just the road trip was pretty appealing to her. ANYWAY, I looked up the event and realized that it was located at some Forecastle music festival. I could hardly afford to drive there, but there&amp;#39;s no way I could buy two of those $90 festival tickets! So, my optimism had me hoping that the HTC trailer would be parked outside of the event gates for anyone to try. I tweeted HTC/Vive and asked what the situation was-- did I need tickets or what? @HTCVive tweeted me back and said to send them a PM on their FB page, which.. I did. AND I GOT THIS BACK!\n&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/6O9HBnD\"&gt;http://imgur.com/gallery/6O9HBnD&lt;/a&gt;\nThey got us free tickets man! When we got there in the morning, we went to the box office, told them my name and that I was with HTC. They told me I was &amp;quot;on the list&amp;quot; and handed me two tickets. HTC escorted us into the gates two hours before the gates opened, slapped some neon bracelets on us and gave us a quick tour of the trailer. The bracelets gave us clearance to take the stairs to the VIP seating area on top of the demo trailer (and get their free drinks). The staff was all really nice and we ended up just chilling with them the whole festival. We waited about 20 minutes for them to finish setting up the demo rooms, and when they had one ready, I went down before my wife (and EVERYONE else) to take the first demo of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**First thing was to fill out a waiver, which was pulled up appropriately on an HTC One M9. I met a young woman who was going to administer my demo, asked me my name, and said &amp;quot;Darrell, I&amp;#39;m gonna take you to a new world.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;...Alrighty then.&amp;quot; The demo room was a dark black box with a PC and monitor (where they could view what you were seeing) in the corner. The lady told me a bunch of oversimplified info about the Vive and VR and helped me strap on the headset. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as you put on the Vive, you&amp;#39;re in a white abyss room, kind of like the Matrix&amp;#39;s training room, with a grey grid on the ground that sort of fades off into the distance. Now, maybe I&amp;#39;m just a baby, but this part somehow made me feel a little sick. I think it was something about the way the grid faded off. Like that doesn&amp;#39;t really happen in real life with anything, and my best bet is that my brain thought I was hallucinating on something and needed to reject the hallucinogenic substance. I&amp;#39;m no doctor though... The screen door effect was pretty evident in the white room, but it wasn&amp;#39;t too bad and I forgot about it pretty quickly. She asked me if I was in the white room. I said yes and she was like &amp;#39;cool, I&amp;#39;ll start you up.&amp;#39; The screen went black. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I was in another white room. The woman picked up and held the Vive controllers in front of my HMD-covered face. I reach off to grab them, and they were right where I expected them to be in space. She instructed me to walk around and pointed out the blue grid-walls that came up to represent where the actual real-world walls were. I could blow balloons out of my virtual controllers and choose different balloon colors from a color wheel on the touch pad. If you knock the balloons around the room, the velocity that you hit them affected the velocity that they traveled-- real life style. All around me there are about 10 or 15 different game title covers. It looks like I could touch the titles and open up different games, but she told me to turn around and press the yellow &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; button instead. Black screen again. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An ocean opened up. I&amp;#39;m on a sunken pirate ship. Fish and stingrays are swimming around and I can walk around a good radius of the poop deck. The field of view was actually much better than I had thought it would be. I really had to make myself LOOK for the edge of the screen. It definitely wasn&amp;#39;t noticeable at all. Nearly all my peripheral vision was filled. You couldn&amp;#39;t really interact with the ocean demo other than shewing some schools of fish away. Everything was just out of reach as a huge whale swam by me and stared into my soul. I felt pretty darn small next to the guy! After the whale almost slapped me to the ground with his tail fin, the demo faded off to black. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the kitchen demo! This is where it got good. I picked up my controllers and they were HANDS! Floating hands with no arms but they felt like MY HANDS! I actually pretty instantly forgot I was holding anything, tried to clap, and hit the bulky controllers together.. I had to apologize. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not trying to break your controllers..&amp;quot; The kitchen was full of.. kitchen stuff: food, utensils, pots, cutting boards, etc. There was a white board in front of me with a soup recipe on it. I didn&amp;#39;t really pay any attention to the instructions unfortunately. I saw a picture of a tomato on the board. &amp;quot;Ok. Here&amp;#39;s a tomato. Do I have a knife?&amp;quot; I look behind me, grab a chef&amp;#39;s knife, take a chop at the tomato and... the knife shatters like sugar-glass-- tomato completely unscathed. &amp;quot;Wha? ..Ok. They think they&amp;#39;re being funny. Where&amp;#39;s another knife?&amp;quot; I find ONE MORE knife behind me, look at it-- it&amp;#39;s kind of a whitish color. &amp;quot;Oookay. This is a ceramic knife, that&amp;#39;s why it broke. Just gotta be more careful.&amp;quot; So, I ever so carefully tried to slice the tomato and IT FREAKING SHATTERED! \u201cWhat am I supposed to do!\u201d I tried using my hands to karate chop the tomato like that episode of Spongebob. Didn\u2019t work, but the tomato looked like it enjoyed it. &amp;quot;Forget it. I don&amp;#39;t care about this soup.&amp;quot; I opened the fridge, grabbed a couple of mushrooms and tested my old juggling skills. I suck. One of the mushrooms landed in the soup pot. I notice that the mushroom ingredient is checked off on the white board. &amp;quot;OH! I just put all the ingredients in there whole!&amp;quot; Just like real life... I pickup a tomato, drop it, and time&amp;#39;s up. Black screen. Crap. I&amp;#39;m an idiot. \nMy wife said she actually followed the instructions and made the soup. When you&amp;#39;re done, there&amp;#39;s a can of tomato soup in the pot. You put the can on a plate, and the plate flys away..... just. like. real. life. She moved on to making a sandwich before her demo ended. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The art demo. It was a sleek 3D Microsoft Paint, and I could draw in there for days. It took place in a black abyss. My right controller had a pen on the end of it, while the left had a cool hologram cube with different icons on each side for brush stroke types, thickness, a color wheel, and a bunch of other options. I drew a straight line. Took a step back. Walked around it\u2026 I just drew a floating pool noodle.. Holy tits. I started drawing this really terrible looking 3D person. Gave him a big booty. Why not. I chose the rainbow stroke brush, and gave him a rainbow heart. It looked like it was pumping. IDK if the game could recognize that I drew a heart and made it pump, or if the rainbow brush just always does that. I drew a floating circle and jumped into it like it was a hoola hoop. Then I had time to play with the snow tool that sprayed gravity-affected snow flakes where ever you aimed. \nMy demo administer lady told me that she had an actual 3D artist come in and draw a crazy spiderman model in like 3 minutes. She also said that an architect drew out a huge blueprint for a room and walked inside of it. All sounds pretty cool, and I think if I had the time, I could have done some really cool things in there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last demo was the one I had been waiting for: the Aperture Science demo. Everything is so detailed. It was beautiful. I wanted to live in this demo. Starts you off in a laboratory room, when a robot voice (not GLADOS) comes on and tells you to charge your power tools (your controllers). He has you do a few things like open some drawers, insulting you with the trademarked Portal sarcasm throughout. (I found the cake in the second drawer.) The voice tells you to find a red lever to open the door. After you pull it, the door lifts up and you see Peabody sitting in a waiting room reading a magazine. Then the clanky, malfunctioning, sparky robot, Atlas comes around the corner and towards you\u2026 Ok. This guy is HUGE in person. I always thought of him being about three or four feet tall, but he was about my height (I\u2019m 5ft, 11in / 1.8m). My wife is about 6 inches shorter than me and she said Atlas was MUCH taller than her. When he was walking toward me, flailing his metal arms, it was intimidating. It felt like the ground was shaking under his weight. I wanted to stand still but my body didn\u2019t let me. I stepped back and got out of his way. After he stopped moving though, I thought I\u2019d try to walk into his body. What\u2019s that like? When I tried, my body felt uncomfortable. My brain was asking me \u201cWhy are you getting so close to that thing?\u201d When I phased through him\u2026 it was the weirdest feeling ever! My brain didn\u2019t know how to handle it. I looked down and couldn\u2019t see my legs (of course I didn\u2019t have a body in the game at all, but I guess I forgot about that). I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it was kind of like when you see an optical illusion that doesn\u2019t make any sense to your brain and it just quickly draws a conclusion of what\u2019s happening\u2014 it kind of makes sense, but it kind of looks like something is wrong. It was kind of like that, but it was just the hardest thing for my brain to reason through. My senses drew like 10 different conclusions until it stopped on \u201cOk. Your legs are somehow painlessly missing and your torso is sitting on top of this robot. I can accept that I guess.\u201d It was a feud uncomfortable feeling the whole time\u2014 but a cool one. It made me really want a game where you could phase through walls like a ghost. \n(Also, I was told that you can actually look inside of his body and see his mechanical components inside of him. It\u2019s not just like a holo Tony Hawk Pro Skater model. The insides are actually detailed.)\nThe voice told me to find a switch on the robot and open him up. I pulled his face open and all his components came out like Tony Stark\u2019s hologram computer system. I could spin it all around and each piece would pop out so I could see it a little better. There were hologram instructions that told you all the extensive things you had to do to fix him and the voice told you that you had 60 seconds to finish before the robot exploded. There\u2019s literally no way you could finish in time. The timer runs out and Atlas collapses\u2014 all his components spread across the floor. \u201cAt least he didn\u2019t explode,\u201d says the voice. \nThe floor panels start to come down and swallow the robot components. Again, my brain isn\u2019t handling this well. I look down the 7-story hole in the floor and\u2026 I want to see what it\u2019s like to walk onto the hole. My body is like \u201cDON\u2019T DO IT!!\u201d My legs feel stiff as I try to walk off of the floor. I step onto the nothingness. It takes a second. My heart rate slows a little. My brain stops screaming and says \u201cOk.. You\u2019re standing on glass. Like in the Space Needle. But you\u2019re still 7 stories up on some glass. This is still uncomfortable. Lets get back on the ground.\u201d So I drag my feet gently back to the floor. \nThe wall drops down and GLADOS comes out. Talking crap about how I can\u2019t do a simple fix on a robot. Whatever mom. \nShe leaves and all fours walls drop behind me, revealing the massive Aperture facility that I\u2019m in. Even though I\u2019m in this tiny room in real life, it suddenly feels like the whole world is around me. It gives me plenty of time to look at all the cool Aperture Labs surroundings while a new room is built around me with the familiar white panels from the Portal games. A companion cube flies out in front of me and I thing \u201cAm I going to be able to shoot portals and stuff?\u201d \u2026Nope. The spiked ceiling comes down and crushes me. End of demo. You suck GLADOS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lady took off my headset, and I was genuinely bummed about being back. The world looked so dull. Granted I was in a dark black cube. But I wanted to go back so bad. My wife and I talked about the experience all day. And she\u2019s totally on board now. Everyone says you can\u2019t understand VR until you try it yourself, and they\u2019re totally right. I need a VR headset now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you go to the Vive tour, and want to ask questions, you should know that most people there don\u2019t work for HTC. Most are there with them only for that particular weekend. Only 3 people are traveling with the entire tour. If you have technical questions, ask for JD. But the guy didn\u2019t really tell me anything I didn\u2019t already know. I asked him if they were doing anything to fix glasses fogging in the headset. He said they\u2019re working on something to fix it, but when I asked if it would be like a fan or something, he just said \u201ccan\u2019t talk about that.\u201d I asked what kind of CPU, GPU &amp;amp; whatnot they were using in their PC setups because I\u2019m building a PC for VR right now. \u201cCan\u2019t tell you that. It would give you an idea of what our system requires, and we don\u2019t want you to know that yet.\u201d \nBUT he and everyone else were very nice and helpful. A great experience over all. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. We got a demo before anyone else, but apparently the actual line was 4 hours long. Holy bananas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope all of you can try this soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "My wife was freaking SICK of hearing me talk about VR. Every time I talked about it, she was like \"Shut up it's not that cool,\" BUT YOU KNOW WHAT! Now she understands!!\n\nFirst, I want to explain why the HTC guys are my best friends now. If you just want to read about the demo I'll put a \"**\" where that starts.\n\nThis past Friday we were trying to figure out something to do for a date. All the movies at the Cinemax suck right now... 'Hey, that HTC Vive Tour is in Louisville this weekend. Let's just skip the movie and go tomorrow!' It was a 6-hour drive and she wasn't excited about it. It took some convincing, but just the road trip was pretty appealing to her. ANYWAY, I looked up the event and realized that it was located at some Forecastle music festival. I could hardly afford to drive there, but there's no way I could buy two of those $90 festival tickets! So, my optimism had me hoping that the HTC trailer would be parked outside of the event gates for anyone to try. I tweeted HTC/Vive and asked what the situation was-- did I need tickets or what? @HTCVive tweeted me back and said to send them a PM on their FB page, which.. I did. AND I GOT THIS BACK!\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/6O9HBnD\nThey got us free tickets man! When we got there in the morning, we went to the box office, told them my name and that I was with HTC. They told me I was \"on the list\" and handed me two tickets. HTC escorted us into the gates two hours before the gates opened, slapped some neon bracelets on us and gave us a quick tour of the trailer. The bracelets gave us clearance to take the stairs to the VIP seating area on top of the demo trailer (and get their free drinks). The staff was all really nice and we ended up just chilling with them the whole festival. We waited about 20 minutes for them to finish setting up the demo rooms, and when they had one ready, I went down before my wife (and EVERYONE else) to take the first demo of the day.\n\n\n**First thing was to fill out a waiver, which was pulled up appropriately on an HTC One M9.

The quality of the experience depends heavily upon the number of photos taken by Google along the route.\n* Audio - Clicking the audio button will toggle through a selection of audio clips. Two collections currently have associated audio that will play if audio is enabled (Oceans and Yosemite). Suggestions via YouTube links are welcome! \n* All Photospheres should now work.\n* List of notable locations has been massively expanded (roughly 3000 places now)\n* Xbox Controller Support - Controls listed below\n* Improved navigation\n* Eyepatch mode - This can help to eliminate conflicting stereoscopic cues improving sense of depth. Recommended with the lights off to prevent light leakage into the HMD. Thanks to /u/eVRydayVR for the suggestion.\n* Bug fixes\n\n##Basic sharing options\n\n* Pressing c will copy a URL-like link to the current panorama. Audio can be attached by adding &amp;YouTubeVideoId to the end.\n* Pressing v will paste a streetviewvr:panoramaid&amp;videoid link, loading the panorama and audio clip.\n* Example URL with associated audio - streetvr:3IXItKTBOkydzJ5s8m31Bw&amp;3yzwpn0VfQg\n* These URLs should be clickable soon. The Oculus SDK was behaving badly with passed data. This will hopefully be resolved in future releases.\n\n###Controls\n\n(Keyboard/XBox)\n\nNavigation\n\n* Left mouse button/A Button: Move along a path (based on look direction - green indicator)\n* Right mouse button/B Button: Show or hide the interface.\n* W and S/Right stick Y axis - Move forward or backward along a path (based on body direction, not look direction - blue indicator)\n* Q and E/Bumpers: Comfort mode turning\n* A and D: Move through locations in a collection. This only works if exploring locations that are part of a collection from the location library.\n\nZoom\n\n* Middle mouse button/Right stick click: Hold to aim, release to take picture (wheel/triggers to change zoom level).\n\nMinimap\n\n* Left Control/Left stick click: Show or hide minimap. \n\nQuality Level\n\n* 1-4/Y Button: Toggle quality level.\n\nIndicators\n\n* Tab: Show/hide compass, indicators and arrows.\n\nRecenter\n\n* R/Back Button: Reset HMD.\n\nRandom Movement\n\n* Z/DPad Left: Jump to random nearby location. The size of the area in which you jump can be adjusted in the settings panel.\n* X/DPad Up : Jump to random location from list.\n\nSharing\n\n* C: Copy panorama id\n* V: Paste panorama id (go to panorama)\n\n###Tips\nTimelapse\n\n* Timelapses can be generated using a route between pins dropped on the map or the forward direction (blue indicator)\n* Timelapse works best on highways. The quality of the experience will depend largely upon the number of photos taken by Google within a given distance along a route.\n* You may continue to explore the world while the timelapse is being generated.\n* Timelapse length, quality and playback speed can be adjusted in settings.\n\nLocation Library\n\n* A large selection of notable locations has been included. This is available by clicking the list icon in the interface.\n\nAudio\n\n* Clicking the audio button will toggle through a selection of audio clips. Some collections have associated audio that will play if audio is enabled (e.g. Oceans and Yosemite)\n\nFast Navigation\n\n* Lowering the quality will allow you to move quickly through the world. Just toggle the quality back up when you stop. I recommend quality level 2 for moving around and 3 for when you stop.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "3dxwj7", "from_kind": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "YoutopiaVR", "media": null, "score": 141, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 38, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2uni5", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "stickied": false, "from": null, "is_self": true, "from_id": null, "permalink": "/r/oculus/comments/3dxwj7/streetview_vr_update_with_timelapse_audio_huge/", "name": "t3_3dxwj7", "created": 1437426193.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/3dxwj7/streetview_vr_update_with_timelapse_audio_huge/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "StreetView VR update with timelapse, audio, huge library of notable locations, photospheres, XBox 360 controller support and more!", "created_utc": 1437397393.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "ups": 141}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.oculus", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "oculus", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt;\nLocomotion in virtual reality is a serious concern. While the majority of players up to now and for the foreseeable future have been working around the idea of an incomplete association between true and virtual motion, the enthusiasts have fretted about the inherent failures in even the best input(thumbstick) and input compensation devices(ODTs) which try to fill that incompleteness. There is no system for free walking which really feels free. The true 1:1 systems, like the Void, are beset by practical difficulties, such as those that come with a fixed physical setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The limitations of true flexibility, where running, walking, crouching, kneeling, jumping &amp;amp;c. can be freed from its range limitation only through what I term &amp;quot;naive&amp;quot; redirection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The body of literature on redirection is fairly decent, but often returns to environment-dependent methods. In the taxonomy constructed by Suma in 2012, these are subtle discrete changes, like change blindness, that can, under good conditions, make you walk less in the real world than you would have in a 1:1, static scenario. They can also be techniques used in modifying checkpoint-based travel (Razzaque 2001). These techniques are powerful, but inflexible. For redirection without changes to game design the subtle continuous changes in Suma&amp;#39;s taxonomy are preferred, namely rotational, translational, and circular gains, which are naive to the game&amp;#39;s content, and do not affect its development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post is a simulation of how well those limits could usefully deform a theoretical path in virtual space to effect a smaller displacement in real space. Please refer to the Steinicke paper to understand what&amp;#39;s being done. The limits of the gains used are derived from Steinicke&amp;#39;s 2010 paper.

The difference between  the two paths should theoretically be difficult to notice in real locomotion. The circles have r = 20 &amp;amp; r = 40 respectively, and the scale is in meters.  Wander determines the &amp;quot;curviness&amp;quot; of a walk. The gains determine how strongly the walk is deformed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Basic principle:&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/6IvqNlC.gif\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/6IvqNlC.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;100 meters, med wander, low gains:&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/vco39er.gif\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/vco39er.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1 kilometer, low(0.1) wander, full gains hereonwards:&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/EItEdjF.gif\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/EItEdjF.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;1 kilometer, high(0.5) wander:&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/qbBU8RJ.gif\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/qbBU8RJ.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;5 kilometers, med(0.3) wander:&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/bIaO2VF.gif\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/bIaO2VF.gif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Distribution of maximal displacements, 5 km medium wander:&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/XQbbHJD.png\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/XQbbHJD.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Distribution of all displacements, 5 km M.W.:&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/6wMz8iZ.png\"&gt;http://i.imgur.com/6wMz8iZ.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantitative Results&lt;/strong&gt;:\nFor 5 kilometers of medium wander walking, the median maximal displacement is 40.2 meters. Half of all simulations (n=500) never cross this boundary. For 5 km, high wander, this value is 29.2 meters. For 5 km, low wander, the value is 43.6 meters. For 1 kilometer, medium wander, the value is only 31.4 m.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;\n5 km is the distance I use as a standard for a significant distance. It&amp;#39;s approximately how long an average person walks in an hour. These simulations use a &lt;em&gt;dead simple&lt;/em&gt; algorithm. Gains are discontinuous in many places and it would almost certainly render you sick, and is vulnerable against a few simple paths.  Still, as is evident, it is very powerful. It should be noted that even though half of all runs crossed 40 meters, the grand majority of positions will be under 20 meters out, and the median position throughout the runs is around 9 meters from the center. Denser paths, like what might be expected inside a city or a building, are more deformable, and long, straight ones are less so, due to the weaker effect of rotational gains with smaller rotations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future:&lt;/strong&gt;\nI am especially interested in developing a proper algorithm to use player velocity to dynamically change gains, as suggested by Neth in his 2012 paper, and also in semi-naive redirection, where points of interest in the game can be used for path prediction and these redirection tools can be more effectively used. For both of these I&amp;#39;ll need real player paths in various games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The areas determined (40+ radius diameter circles) will not be found in a home, or indoors at all.

I would rather spend an evening a week doing this in a baseball park with a few friends than spend the rest of the week doing regular sitting VR. It will of course be far less convenient, but it will doubtlessly be more presence-inducing, more active, and more social, depending on how many headsets you could get in there. This isn&amp;#39;t an idea for the millions, but it will be good for a good dozen.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this is a serious project for me.

I won&amp;#39;t to go over each demo individually since everyone knows what the demo reel is by now. Mostly just the overall experience and impressions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The experience surpassed what I expected even with all of the hype that I had built up personally. :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I develop for both DK2 and GearVR and this made me excited once again for the future. This was mostly due to the room scale tracking and being able to interact with virtual objects, and the content.  I felt presence most of the time, and there were only a few minor things that could be easily tweaked that took me out of it on occasion.

I took the HMD off and on to see how far off, i&amp;#39;d say the controllers were 2&amp;quot; in front of where my actual real hands were. The tracking was perfect though, I shook them fast and no noticeable latency. I am guessing because my IPD was not correctly calibrated they appeared slightly farther away. But the chaparone system was overall in the exact location as the walls in real life except for one wall, which I ran into several times. So I&amp;#39;m not sure what was going on there. There appear to be minor calibration issues depending on what room you get.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall that didn&amp;#39;t matter though because the tracking volume and input added something I did not expect to be this important. It made the scale of things much better. It made me realize the accommodation depth cue may not be quite that important as I had originally told myself. The edge in the portal demo felt like a real drop thanks to the tracking volume, I did not want to take a step forward just as was desribed by others in the past, but probably could have forced myself to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This room scale tracking, the motion parallax and my vestibular sense matching everything I was doing added something amazing here that I can&amp;#39;t describe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are in the Chicago area you definitely have try to check this out.
