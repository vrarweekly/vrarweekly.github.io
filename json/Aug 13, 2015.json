i wasn&amp;#39;t sure to be able to see anything at all as i hadn&amp;#39;t any Demo Slots reserved nor any &amp;quot;Buisness appointment&amp;quot;. When i was at cologne on Wednesday i saw that Oculus got some additional Demo slots and i reserved one for Thursday, so i got at least that covered. As i was there Wednesday morning at 9 i tried to get a HTC Vive Demo at their Booth. They said you only get a demo if you reserved a demo slot, but you might get a demo if someone doesnt come. I didn&amp;#39;t expect good chance to get a demo (why would anyone NOT come to see the Awesomeness that is the Vive) so i roamed gamescom to see if there are other booth with demos and i indeed found the Nvidia Booth. They gave away 2x2 VIP Tickets for a demo hourly. They picked 2 random people of the crowd that volunteered to answer one question and winning 2 tickets if you get the right answer. I was there at 10:30 and didnt get picked. I was there at 11:30 and didnt get picked, and i was there at 12:30 and this time got picked. At 12:30 i was standing there with my arm raised up before he even asked who volunteered. The guy on the stage recogniced me and picked me because i was so persistent to get a demo. But i still had to answer a question... and actually i didnt know the answer for sure. But the guy helped me with answering for me by excluding 2 out of 3 answers. So i got to get the Vive Demo:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Vive Impression: &lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have DK1, DK2 and GearVR and im not really new to VR. To impress me with VR is not as easy anymore. But Vive managed that. It was a whole new experience and it lived up to the high expectations. Being able to walk around and to interact with your hands is so much better. Its much more immersive to be IN the world and almost natuarally interact with it than to sit and see a world from an &amp;quot;outside&amp;quot; perspective and influence this world you with an xbox controller. At the Nvidia Booth they demoed the Underwater Demo, Tilt Brush and Aperature Demo (no Dota demo - i would have loved to see this).  Demos were quite impressive and tech was fine. One controller had some issues with detection because of empty battery but it was still awesome. I didnt really look for the small tech details like SDE and chromatic aberration, but this is anyway you only notice if you look for it or if you are new to VR. Obviously SDE was better than on DK2 but i dont even notice it on DK2 anymore. There is no SDE once you are immersed. Also i didnt really look for FOV but i think its a bit larger than on DK2 and CV. Actually i couldnt care about the details as i was just &amp;quot;WOWed&amp;quot; by being able to walk around in the large tracking volume and to have motion controls. I just enjoyed the whole new Level of VR experience and the tech details just didnt matter (and that is actually a good sign). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Rift CV Impression&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since i had 2 VIP cards and i went to gamescom alone i also tested the Rift afterwards. Actually it was an underwhelming experience after Vive. Sitting there with an Xbox controller felt like a step back to the experience i had before. Also Eve Valkeryie made me sick. I get sick VERY fast (even after one and half year into VR Usage and Development). I still wondered why Eve made me sick as i had no issues in Elite for several hours. This was either an IPD issue or because the scene is brighter than elite. Because of the motion sickness i couldnt really enjoy the demo and i also couldnt really look at the details. But i also got a second demo the next day. (Also Nvidia messed the demo up a bit. My head was about 50 cm above my virtual body and i explained the demo girl she has to reset positional tracking but she had absolutly no clue what i was talking about. Btw: The Vive demo also had no AA enabled and i experienced occasional tearing because Vsync seem to be switched off too. I really wonder why they pay so much money for a booth and then fail to get at least 1-2 people that actually have some idea of the tech they are showing...). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall i was really satisfied with that day as the Vive showed me whole new level of VR and it was somehow like the first &amp;quot;WOW&amp;quot; moments of VR again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Thursday&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a satisfying Wednesday, Thursday got even better. When i woke up i saw an email from Valve that they already had sent my Vive Dev Kit and that i will be delivered the same day (i didnt expect it so early and actually thought it would take a month since i got the confirmation that i get one). I already was even more hyped to get my hands on it since i tried it the day before. Knowing that i have one when i come home from gamescom already made my day. But it got even better....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;CV1 Impression #2&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a Demo slot at 10:00 and this time i tried &amp;quot;Edge of Nowhere&amp;quot;. I really liked the experience and i liked CV1. This time i didnt get sick and i could look a bit more at the details. They really polished the optics and the form factor. SDE was barely noticeable and i noticed no Chromatic aberration. The optics seemed a (tiny) bit better than Vive (Sharper image in periphery) but the differences are minor. But FOV of CV1 seemed a bit smaller than Vive and im not sure if its even smaller than Dk2. Audio was good quality, but im not really an audiophile and i dont think im qualified to talk about good audio. I really like CV1 but there where 2 issues. First: The Rift was getting hot and i started to sweat. Second: I walked around in the Vive demo the day before and now i cant go back to a seated experience with an Xbox controller. I really CANT. VR is sooooo much more awesome if you can walk around and interact through good motion controlls. Overall the 2 Rift demos where much less impressive than the Vive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Vive seemed to be the clear winner for me, ... until later that day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was an &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/3fvmkv/are_you_at_gamescom_join_the_informal_vr_meetup/\"&gt;informal meetup&lt;/a&gt; at 2 o&amp;#39;clock with some indie devs and enthusiast and i hoped that someone from Oculus (Dev rel or something) would join the meetup. So i walked to the Oculus Booth in the Business Area at around 1 o&amp;#39;clock. I didnt see anyone from Dev Relations but actually Brendan Iribe was standing around at the entrance and so i just asked him if he wants to join the meetup. He was really nice and said he&amp;#39;d love to come but he had a meeting at the same time, but he said that maybe Palmer has time to come. In the end &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; came (a bit later) to the meetup and made me and the other devs/enthusiast happy just by showing up. (&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/vondeutschmann/status/629402530141745153\"&gt;Check this 360 Photo&lt;/a&gt; ). But the coolest thing was that Brendan asked me if I already had seen Oculus Touch and as i said no he said i could get a demo if i wanted to. Oh and i definitely wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Oculus Touch Impression&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The demo was awesome. From what i saw Touch is comparable to \nvives controller in terms of tracking but i liked the form factor more. Interaction also was more intuitive. Grabbing stuff by more or less closing your hands really felt intuitive and you don&amp;#39;t even need to get used to the ways how to interact. Overall impression of Touch was a bit better than Vives controller mainly because of the form factor. If someone throws something to you you just catch without thinking about how to do it. &amp;quot;If someone throwing stuff at you...&amp;quot; that was the actual thing that really &amp;quot;wow&amp;#39;ed&amp;quot; me and topped the Vive demo. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Social Interaction (Telepresence) Impression:&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most amazing thing werent the controllers - which are awesome and as i said before were a bit better than the vive controllers. But what totally blew me away, it was the way i was lead through the demo. You see a virtual operator (whos actually in another room) right before you. His representation doesnt even come close to look like a real person, nor even a good 3D model. Just a really simple blue head mesh and 2 separate hand meshes floating around. When the operator talks to you the mesh gets distorted where the mouth is supposed to be (like some simple oldscool winamp audio visualisation) . But damn this works well. Also Audio spatialisation did it part and while you were just seeing an unrealistic representation it really felt like the person was there just because you can interact and his voice is coming from where it SHOULD come from. I simply couldnt stop the feeling that the operator stands right before me. And i was really surprised that it works by just giving some principal visual cues. Interaction and audio spatialisation and some principle visual clues is already enough to really have Telepresence. The most awesome moment was when we played ping pong. The latency was so low and the tracking so precise it really felt like i was playing ping pong with another person. Btw: its not the first time i test motion controls. I have a hydra and leap motion and i saw my hands before in VR. But latency and precision of Vive Controllers and Oculus Touch really make a huge difference. I really can&amp;#39;t describe the overall experience properly. Presence in VR is already amazing but Social Interaction and Telepresence is ... witchcraft. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the last 2 years there were quite a lot moments where i saw a glimpse of the metaverse. The last 2 days i saw it starting to unfold...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: Vive is Awesome. CV1 + Touch is Awesome. Social interaction in VR is witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Wednesday:\n--------------\n--------------\n\nIntro\n-------\n\nWhen i drove to Gamescom i wasn't sure to be able to see anything at all as i hadn't any Demo Slots reserved nor any \"Buisness appointment\".

I really wonder why they pay so much money for a booth and then fail to get at least 1-2 people that actually have some idea of the tech they are showing...). \n\nOverall i was really satisfied with that day as the Vive showed me whole new level of VR and it was somehow like the first \"WOW\" moments of VR again.\n\n\nThursday\n----------\n--------------\n\nIntro\n------\n\nAfter a satisfying Wednesday, Thursday got even better. When i woke up i saw an email from Valve that they already had sent my Vive Dev Kit and that i will be delivered the same day (i didnt expect it so early and actually thought it would take a month since i got the confirmation that i get one). I already was even more hyped to get my hands on it since i tried it the day before. Knowing that i have one when i come home from gamescom already made my day. But it got even better....\n\nCV1 Impression #2\n-------------------------\nI got a Demo slot at 10:00 and this time i tried \"Edge of Nowhere\". I really liked the experience and i liked CV1. This time i didnt get sick and i could look a bit more at the details. They really polished the optics and the form factor. SDE was barely noticeable and i noticed no Chromatic aberration. The optics seemed a (tiny) bit better than Vive (Sharper image in periphery) but the differences are minor. But FOV of CV1 seemed a bit smaller than Vive and im not sure if its even smaller than Dk2. Audio was good quality, but im not really an audiophile and i dont think im qualified to talk about good audio. I really like CV1 but there where 2 issues. First: The Rift was getting hot and i started to sweat. Second: I walked around in the Vive demo the day before and now i cant go back to a seated experience with an Xbox controller. I really CANT. VR is sooooo much more awesome if you can walk around and interact through good motion controlls. Overall the 2 Rift demos where much less impressive than the Vive. \n\nSo Vive seemed to be the clear winner for me, ... until later that day.\n\nThere was an [informal meetup](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/3fvmkv/are_you_at_gamescom_join_the_informal_vr_meetup/) at 2 o'clock with some indie devs and enthusiast and i hoped that someone from Oculus (Dev rel or something) would join the meetup. So i walked to the Oculus Booth in the Business Area at around 1 o'clock. I didnt see anyone from Dev Relations but actually Brendan Iribe was standing around at the entrance and so i just asked him if he wants to join the meetup. He was really nice and said he'd love to come but he had a meeting at the same time, but he said that maybe Palmer has time to come. In the end **both** came (a bit later) to the meetup and made me and the other devs/enthusiast happy just by showing up. ([Check this 360 Photo] (https://twitter.com/vondeutschmann/status/629402530141745153) ). But the coolest thing was that Brendan asked me if I already had seen Oculus Touch and as i said no he said i could get a demo if i wanted to. Oh and i definitely wanted to.\n\nOculus Touch Impression\n--------------------------\nThe demo was awesome. From what i saw Touch is comparable to \nvives controller in terms of tracking but i liked the form factor more. Interaction also was more intuitive. Grabbing stuff by more or less closing your hands really felt intuitive and you don't even need to get used to the ways how to interact. Overall impression of Touch was a bit better than Vives controller mainly because of the form factor. If someone throws something to you you just catch without thinking about how to do it. \"If someone throwing stuff at you...\" that was the actual thing that really \"wow'ed\" me and topped the Vive demo. \n\nSocial Interaction (Telepresence) Impression:\n--------------------------------------\nThe most amazing thing werent the controllers - which are awesome and as i said before were a bit better than the vive controllers. But what totally blew me away, it was the way i was lead through the demo. You see a virtual operator (whos actually in another room) right before you. His representation doesnt even come close to look like a real person, nor even a good 3D model. Just a really simple blue head mesh and 2 separate hand meshes floating around. When the operator talks to you the mesh gets distorted where the mouth is supposed to be (like some simple oldscool winamp audio visualisation) . But damn this works well. Also Audio spatialisation did it part and while you were just seeing an unrealistic representation it really felt like the person was there just because you can interact and his voice is coming from where it SHOULD come from. I simply couldnt stop the feeling that the operator stands right before me. And i was really surprised that it works by just giving some principal visual cues. Interaction and audio spatialisation and some principle visual clues is already enough to really have Telepresence. The most awesome moment was when we played ping pong. The latency was so low and the tracking so precise it really felt like i was playing ping pong with another person. Btw: its not the first time i test motion controls. I have a hydra and leap motion and i saw my hands before in VR. But latency and precision of Vive Controllers and Oculus Touch really make a huge difference. I really can't describe the overall experience properly. Presence in VR is already amazing but Social Interaction and Telepresence is ... witchcraft. \n\nIn the last 2 years there were quite a lot moments where i saw a glimpse of the metaverse. The last 2 days i saw it starting to unfold...\n\n**TL;DR**: Vive is Awesome. CV1 + Touch is Awesome. Social interaction in VR is witchcraft.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "3g4vqw", "from_kind": null, "gilded": 0,

for the communication (or lack of), you are completely right, we could have used some better advice and more help in that department. Being in a two person team means that we can not do all the things we want and we are stretched thin. What was it that Bilbo said? &amp;#39;I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.&amp;#39;- it&amp;#39;s kinda like that!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were invited to San Fran for three months to be a part of this wonderful Boost programme, but that means there is only 3 months where we can work together before we have the visa problem all over again. We have hit development hard and are pulling in some crazy hours but we know it&amp;#39;s the only way we can get everything done. The timing was not great, had we known sooner we may have not even done a kickstarter or at least held off for a few months and asked for less money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s awesome that people think the first demo was already a complete game, but that is but a fraction of what we want to do with it. On top of that there are so many costs that people don&amp;#39;t know exist. Legal fees, accounting, licences, actors, animators and studio hire to name some. We also need to eat from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the release of one episode, that was a really hard decision to make. But the school level is going to take place over various different environments. I&amp;#39;m currently building a headmaster&amp;#39;s office and Ana is coding up a whole new gameboy game for it. We strongly feel that the best gaming experiences come from a perspective of surprise, and we had hoped that people would trust us when we say &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s going to be a bunch of new mini games and environments&amp;quot; without giving away all the details. We didn&amp;#39;t want to spoil it! But we see now that that was a big ask of us. Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is that we didn&amp;#39;t want to cut down the level, we have so many ideas for it, but please remember that each &amp;quot;year&amp;quot; is a whole new set of environments, characters and mini games. We don&amp;#39;t have the luxury of reusing any assets, and in a team of 2 we would probably not see the game being released until 2019 if we did it all alone. The Boost moto here is &amp;quot;be a cockroach and don&amp;#39;t die&amp;quot;- that&amp;#39;s how an indie team survives, but there is no way we would be able to survive long enough to do the full 5 levels at once.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we opted for episodes. In a perfect world we will be able to expand our team after the first episode releases and we can get out the other four much more quickly. We are not stretching it out or using this as an opportunity to get more profits (we aren&amp;#39;t the producers of The Hobbit), we will charge a fifth of what the full game would have retailed at. No decision has been made lightly, and we just want to make an awesome game and survive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are so sorry that we dropped the ball on communication. Moving to a new time zone is only half an excuse. The truth is we just have our heads down and are working all the hours that we aren&amp;#39;t sleeping and didn&amp;#39;t think that made for an exciting update.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Kickstarter didn&amp;#39;t hit the right kind of numbers in day 1 and for the first week we spent every hour of every day just trying to chat to the community. We knew we couldn&amp;#39;t keep that up for a month solid, and we couldn&amp;#39;t afford to go even further behind in our schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be brutally honest, it&amp;#39;s a long shot now, right? But what we have gained from doing the Kickstarter is fantastic. We have had such amazing support from the people on twitter and reddit (at least when we weren&amp;#39;t being rubbish we did!) \nWe got in PC Gamer - which was on my bucket list! We were invited to San Fran to work together in a room with other incredible VR projects. We got to visit Oculus HQ and try out the new controls (which btw are AWESOME)\nAnd most importantly we got the band back together. Just being in the same room means that we can have some excellent idea sessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yes, if the KS was a success that would be the icing on the cake and we would use the money to do 2 episodes. I&amp;#39;m sure we could  work out some way of giving both levels to the backers. But if it doesn&amp;#39;t work out, we are still going to crack on with this level for the next three months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have all been amazing, and we are so pumped to be on this mad VR adventure with you all. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nFirstly sorry for the communication (or lack of), you are completely right, we could have used some better advice and more help in that department.
