Hi there,

My previous ['Future For Lunar Flight'](http://steamcommunity.com/app/208600/discussions/0/846954921840332963/) post was created back in May 2013 over 2 years ago now.

self.oculus | [comments (63)](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/3bh2rg/how_to_play_youtube_360_videos_with_a_dk2/)
It is mind boggling that tablets, phones, ~~GearVR~~ and google cardboard can experience YouTube's recent crop of 360 VR videos but that there isn't an easy way to consume them on the Rift.

**The 0.6 SDK brings a lot of improvements:**

* CPU usage is now negligible (around 1%) on Windows 8 or 10
* Latency is [...]

It's time for the biweekly Sixense STEM thread..

This is it, next year it will all be different. Consumer VR will be out and the anticipation, hopes and dreams will all be slightly paler as we experience first hand regularly what we have only snatched at in sound bites and articles. 

Nothing can ever be as good as we imagine them to be, it will b[...]
