Seriously, so much hate, bad emotions, FUD, throwing tantrums, people jumping into ridiculous conclusions - this place seems to be inhabited by so many unstable manchild... (I hope they are just a vocal minority).

Why everything is actually going 'horribly right'?

Make a VR exlcusive game, sure.

Don't make a game locked down to a specific headset for no reason.

If they have unique input, something like the Vive controllers. Sure you might want to lock it down to work with those controllers.

&gt; We want to increase things – the whole experience – whether it's resolution, optics, tracking, everything is gonna get better very rapidly.

&gt; But it's gonna be incredible right now, today, with the Oculus Rift.

Part of a very nice interview that can be found here.

Paging /u/Notdagreatbrain

Rift:  
How is the FOV?  
Did they really do away with screen door effect?  
How much tracking volume and angle do we get?   
How hard is it to add a second tracker?  
Price?  If they're not specific have they maintained their $200 - $400 price point?
