self.oculus | [comments (185)](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/3iqyy1/psa_the_vive_has_not_been_delayed_regular_people/)

After there was some confusion yesterday about the term "community systems" (some people thought this means VIPs or press or Youtubers) I asked Valve's Doug Lombardi and he confirmed that the Vive will indeed be available for regular people, as long stocks last.

I bought my DK2 last year in November and I've spent countless hours in it. I have enjoyed every minute and I've been an avid VR enthusiast for a long time.

I had always thought that I had experienced presence. I have read many arguments here among our members about the difference between "immersio[...]

In light of the recent pitchforking, rudeness and disrespect shown to Palmer I'd just like to state the following.

1) There are a lot of us out there still pumped about the rift.

2) We don't live in a world of fairy tales where Valve can easily out develop a team of specialists headhunted and dedi[...]

self.oculus | [comments (13)](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/3izd01/my_perception_neuron_kit_included_two_left_gloves/)

With all the shit revolving around STEM, Prio and ControlVR recently I thought I'd post some news about one of these companies that actually seems to know what they're doing.

Needless to say I'm very happy with Noitom's customer service. Responsive, they understood the problem exactly, didn't have [...]
