You will need to confirm registration immediately.  It would be great if everyone could go to Connect, but the real world has unfortunate limits like fire code and catering limits.

What I want when I visit share.oculus is p[...]

I bought my Rift 3 days after it went on pre-order,. I waited 6 months to receive it. It died 1 month after usage, orange light issue. Oculus replaced it, paid for free shipping back. Something was fishy about the new A lenses (fisheye effect). Oculus sent me 2 new A lenses without any charges. A ye[...]

Hello guys!

It's been a long time, but I'm happy to present to you new version of SightLine: The Chair, which is **the biggest update to the date!**

self.GoogleCardboard | [comments (15)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/3k1mup/a_word_of_caution_be_careful_outdoors_you_have/)

Picked the headset up to call someone right back up and I have two spots on my screen that are messed up now. Still working,[...]
